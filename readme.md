## On-chain Investment Funds Reimagined 📈

A better way to structure Investment Funds, extending Safe through a module that enables the functionality of a fully fleged regulated Investment Fund.

## Why is this good for Safe?
Statista estimates that $60 Trillion lives in Investment Funds in 2022. Over the long term these assets will flow on-chain. This represents a cartoonishly large opportunity for technology providers to house these flows. The TVL a regulatory considerate Investment Fund framework could bring to Safe is immense.

## How, simply?
* Investment Fund Module provides the logic to run a Fund
* Zodiac Roles Modifier ensures sound access control
* Investors use Safe with Auth Kit for MPC & improved key managment

### Planned Features (MVP): 📅

* 👫 Stakeholder management (Fund Admin, Manager, Investor, Guardian)
* 💸 AUM Fee & HWM Performance Fee
* 💰 Withdraw/Invest Queue
* 🔄 Admin state updates
* 🏳️ Investor KYC Whitelist
* 🏛️ Jurisdiction specific regulation

### P.S
Please note some legacy code here relfects the initial idea for this project that is now stale, a small scale personal Fund framework. Stay tuned - substantial refactoring incoming!
