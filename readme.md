## On-chain Investment Funds Reimagined 📈

Extending Safe through a module/plugin that enables the functionality of an institutional grade Investment Fund with legal recognition.

## The Opportunity 💎

In light of the prevailing momentum in tokenisation, trillions of dollars in assets are poised to transition onto blockchain networks. Leading financial institutions, including Citi, project a substantial $4 to $5 trillion in asset tokenisation by 2030. As a significant portion of global financial assets currently resides in traditional investment funds, it follows that a substantial share of these newly tokenised assets will naturally gravitate towards on-chain, or tokenised, investment funds. These tokenised funds offer key benefits such as enhanced operational efficiency, cost reduction, and increased transparency, making it prudent to extend tokenisation to both the asset and the fund.
